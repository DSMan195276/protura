/* Note that it's important that inbetween 'task_fd_get_empty()' returning an
 * fd, and the fd being assigned a pointer value, that we don't accidentally
 * return the same fd a second time if it is requested. IE. Two threads both
 * requesting fd's should recieve unique fd's, even if they're calling
 * task_fd_get_empty() at the exact same time.
 *
 * Thus, empty entries in the file table are marked with NULL, and we do an
 * atomic compare-and-swap to swap the NULL with a non-null temporary value
 * (-1). This non-null value means that subsiquent calls to task_fd_get_empty()
 * won't return the same fd even if the returned fd's have yet to be assigned.
 * (The caller will replace the temporary value with a valid filp after the
 * call).
