userspace
=========

This folder comprises all of the coresponding userspace programs that are part
of the OS (With some 'extra' optional programs). It also includes all the
information necessary for creating a full root filesystem for the OS. Most of
that is in the `root` folder, which is used along with `./obj/disk_root` and
the `copy_root.sh` script in the `scripts` folder to populate the root
filesystem.
